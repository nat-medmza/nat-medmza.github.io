And Still I Rise<br/>
<p>
You may write me down in history<br/>
With your bitter, twisted lies,<br/>
You may tread me in the very dirt<br/>
But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Does my sassiness upset you?<br/>
Why are you beset with gloom?<br/>
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br/>
Pumping in my living room.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Just like moons and like suns,<br/>
With the certainty of tides,<br/>
Just like hopes springing high,<br/>
Still I'll rise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Did you want to see me broken?<br/>
Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br/>
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br/>
Weakened by my soulful cries.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Does my haughtiness offend you?<br/>
Don't you take it awful hard<br/>
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br/>
Diggin' in my own back yard.<br/>
</p>
<p>
You may shoot me with your words,<br/>
You may cut me with your eyes,<br/>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br/>
But still, like air, I'll rise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Does my sexiness upset you?<br/>
Does it come as a surprise<br/>
That I dance like I've got diamonds<br/>
At the meeting of my thighs?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Out of the huts of history's shame<br/>
I rise<br/>
Up from a past that's rooted in pain<br/>
I rise<br/>
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br/>
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br/>
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br/>
I rise<br/>
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear<br/>
I rise<br/>
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br/>
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br/>
I rise<br/>
I rise<br/>
I rise.<br/>
</p>
