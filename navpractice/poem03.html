The Road Not Taken<br/>
<p>
  O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br/>
  The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br/>
  The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br/>
  While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br/>
                           But O heart! heart! heart!<br/>
                              O the bleeding drops of red,<br/>
                                 Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br/>
                                    Fallen cold and dead.<br/>
                                  </p>
<p>
  O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br/>
  Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,<br/>
  For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br/>
  For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br/>
                           Here Captain! dear father!<br/>
                              This arm beneath your head!<br/>
                                 It is some dream that on the deck,<br/>
                                   You’ve fallen cold and dead.<br/>
                                 </p>
<p>
  My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br/>
  My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br/>
  The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br/>
  From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br/>
                           Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br/>
                              But I with mournful tread,<br/>
                                 Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br/>
                                    Fallen cold and dead.<br/>
                                  </p>
